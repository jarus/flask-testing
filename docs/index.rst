Flask-Testing
*************

.. module:: flask_testing

The **Flask-Testing** extension provides unit testing utilities for Flask.

Installing Flask-Testing
========================

Install with **pip** and **easy_install**::

    pip install Flask-Testing

or download the latest version from version control::

    git clone https://github.com/jarus/flask-testing.git
    cd flask-testing
    python setup.py develop

If you are using **virtualenv**, it is assumed that you are installing **Flask-Testing**
in the same virtualenv as your Flask application(s).

Writing tests
=============

Simply subclass the ``TestCase`` class::

    from flask.ext.testing import TestCase

    class MyTest(TestCase):

        pass


You must specify the ``create_app`` method, which should return a Flask instance::

    from flask.ext.testing import TestCase

    class MyTest(TestCase):

        def create_app(self):

            app = Flask(__name__)
            app.config['TESTING'] = True
            return app

If you don't define ``create_app`` a ``NotImplementedError`` will be raised.


Testing with LiveServer
-----------------------

If you want your tests done via Selenium or other headless browser like
PhantomJS you can use the LiveServerTestCase::

    import urllib2
    from flask.ext.testing import LiveServerTestCase
    
    class MyTest(LiveServerTestCase):

        def create_app(self):
            app = Flask(__name__)
            app.config['TESTING'] = True
            # Default port is 5000
            app.config['LIVESERVER_PORT'] = 8943
            return app

        def test_server_is_up_and_running(self):
            response = urllib2.urlopen(self.get_server_url())
            self.assertEqual(response.code, 200)

The method ``get_server_url`` will return http://localhost:8943 in this case.


Testing JSON responses
----------------------

If you are testing a view that returns a JSON response, you can test the output using
a special ``json`` attribute appended to the ``Response`` object::

    @app.route("/ajax/")
    def some_json():
        return jsonify(success=True)

    class TestViews(TestCase):
        def test_some_json(self):
            response = self.client.get("/ajax/")
            self.assertEquals(response.json, dict(success=True))

Opt to not render the templates
-------------------------------

When testing with mocks the template rendering can be a problem. If you don't want to render 
the templates in the tests you can use the ``render_templates`` attribute::

    class TestNotRenderTemplates(TestCase):

        render_templates = False

        def test_assert_not_process_the_template(self):
            response = self.client.get("/template/")

            assert "" == response.data

The signal will be sent anyway so that you can check if the template was rendered using
the ``assert_template_used`` method::

    class TestNotRenderTemplates(TestCase):

        render_templates = False

        def test_assert_mytemplate_used(self):
            response = self.client.get("/template/")

            self.assert_template_used('mytemplate.html')

When the template rendering is turned off the tests will also run faster and the view logic
can be tested in isolation.

Using with Twill
----------------

`Twill`_ is a simple language for browsing the Web through
a command line interface.

**Compatibility**: Please note that Twill only supports Python 2.x and therefore cannot be used with Python 3 or above.

``Flask-Testing`` comes with a helper class for creating functional tests using Twill::

    def test_something_with_twill(self):

        with Twill(self.app, port=3000) as t:
            t.browser.go(t.url("/"))


The older ``TwillTestCase`` has been deprecated.

Testing with SQLAlchemy
-----------------------

This covers a couple of points if you are using **Flask-Testing** with `SQLAlchemy`_. It is
assumed that you are using the `Flask-SQLAlchemy`_ extension, but if not the examples should
not be too difficult to adapt to your own particular setup.

First, ensure you set the database URI to something other than your production database ! Second,
it's usually a good idea to create and drop your tables with each test run, to ensure clean tests::

    from flask.ext.testing import TestCase

    from myapp import create_app, db

    class MyTest(TestCase):

        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite://"
        TESTING = True

        def create_app(self):

            # pass in test configuration
            return create_app(self)

        def setUp(self):

            db.create_all()

        def tearDown(self):

            db.session.remove()
            db.drop_all()

Notice also that ``db.session.remove()`` is called at the end of each test, to ensure the SQLAlchemy
session is properly removed and that a new session is started with each test run - this is a common
"gotcha".

Another gotcha is that Flask-SQLAlchemy **also** removes the session instance at the end of every request (as
should any thread safe application using SQLAlchemy with **scoped_session**). Therefore the session
is cleared along with any objects added to it every time you call ``client.get()`` or another client method.

For example::

    class SomeTest(MyTest):

        def test_something(self):

            user = User()
            db.session.add(user)
            db.session.commit()

            # this works
            assert user in db.session

            response = self.client.get("/")

            # this raises an AssertionError
            assert user in db.session

You now have to re-add the "user" instance back to the session with ``db.session.add(user)``, if you are going
to make any further database operations on it.

Also notice that for this example the SQLite in-memory database is used : while it is faster for tests,
if you have database-specific code (e.g. for MySQL or PostgreSQL) it may not be applicable.

You may also want to add a set of instances for your database inside of a ``setUp()`` once your database
tables have been created. If you want to work with larger sets of data, look at `Fixture`_ which includes
support for SQLAlchemy.

Running tests
=============

with unittest
-------------

For the beginning I go on the theory that you put all your tests into one file
than you can use the :func:`unittest.main` function. This function will discover
all your test methods in your :class:`TestCase` classes. Remember, the test
methods and classes must starts with ``test`` (case-insensitive) that they will
discover.

An example test file cloud look like this::

    import unittest
    import flask.ext.testing

    # your test cases

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

Now you can run your tests with ``python tests.py``.

with nose
---------

The `nose`_ collector and test runner works also fine with Flask-Testing.

Changes
=======

* **0.4 (06.07.2012)**

  * Use of the new introduced import way for flask extensions. Use ``import flask.ext.testing`` instead of ``import flaskext.testing``.
  * Replace all ``assert`` with ``self.assert*`` methods for better output with unittest.
  * Improved Python 2.5 support.
  * Use Flask's preferred JSON module.
