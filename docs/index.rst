Flask-Testing
======================================

.. module:: flask-testing

The **Flask-Testing** extension provides unit testing utilities for Flask.

Installing Flask-Testing
------------------------

Install with **pip** and **easy_install**::

    pip install Flask-Testing

or download the latest version from version control::

    git clone https://github.com/rduplain/flask-testing.git
    cd flask-testing
    python setup.py develop

If you are using **virtualenv**, it is assumed that you are installing **Flask-Testing**
in the same virtualenv as your Flask application(s).

Writing unit tests
------------------

Simply subclass the ``TestCase`` class::

    from flaskext.testing import TestCase

    class MyTest(TestCase):

        pass


You must specify the ``create_app`` method, which should return a Flask instance::

    from flaskext.testing import TestCase

    class MyTest(TestCase):

        def create_app(self):

            app = Flask(__name__)
            app.config['TESTING'] = True
            return app

If you don't define ``create_app`` a ``NotImplementedError`` will be raised.

Testing JSON responses
----------------------

If you are testing a view that returns a JSON response, you can test the output using
a special ``json`` attribute appended to the ``Response`` object::

    @app.route("/ajax/")
    def some_json():
        return jsonify(success=True)

    class TestViews(TestCase):
        def test_some_json(self):
            response = self.client.get("/ajax/")
            self.assertEquals(response.json, dict(success=True))

Using with Twill
----------------

`Twill`_ is a simple language for browing the Web through
a command line interface. 

``Flask-Testing`` comes with a helper class for creating functional tests using Twill::

    def test_something_with_twill(self):

        with Twill(self.app, port=3000) as t:
            t.browser.go(t.url("/"))


The older ``TwillTestCase`` has been deprecated.

Testing with SQLAlchemy
-----------------------

This covers a couple of points if you are using **Flask-Testing** with `SQLAlchemy`_. It is 
assumed that you are using the `Flask-SQLAlchemy`_ extension, but if not the examples should
not be too difficult to adapt to your own particular setup.

First, ensure you set the database URI to something other than your production database ! Second,
it's usually a good idea to create and drop your tables with each test run, to ensure clean tests::

    from flaskext.testing import TestCase
    
    from myapp import create_app, db

    class MyTest(TestCase):
        
        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite://"
        TESTING = True

        def create_app(self):
            
            # pass in test configuration
            return create_app(self)
        
        def setUp(self):

            db.create_all()

        def tearDown(self):

            db.session.remove()
            db.drop_all()

Notice also that ``db.session.remove()`` is called at the end of each test, to ensure the SQLAlchemy
session is properly removed and that a new session is started with each test run - this is a common
"gotcha".

Another gotcha is that Flask-SQLAlchemy **also** removes the session instance at the end of every request (as
should any threadsafe application using SQLAlchemy with **scoped_session**). Therefore the session
is cleared along with any objects added to it every time you call ``client.get()`` or another client method. 

For example::

    class SomeTest(MyTest):
        
        def test_something(self):

            user = User()
            db.session.add(user)
            db.session.commit()

            # this works
            assert user in db.session

            response = self.client.get("/")

            # this raises an AssertionError
            assert user in db.session

You now have to re-add the "user" instance back to the session with ``db.session.add(user)``, if you are going
to make any further database operations on it.

Also notice that for this example the SQLite in-memory database is used : while it is faster for tests,
if you have database-specific code (e.g. for MySQL or PostgreSQL) it may not be applicable.

You may also want to add a set of instances for your database inside of a ``setUp()`` once your database
tables have been created. If you want to work with larger sets of data, look at `Fixture`_ which includes
support for SQLAlchemy.
